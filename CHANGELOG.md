## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Added
- Added `Messages` type alias for `Vec<Message>`.
- Added semlesss integration to work with vercel's ai-sdk-ui.
- Added seamless integration to work with axum + vercel's ai-sdk ui.
- Added Google provider
- Added `Extensions` struct for attaching provider-specific metadata to core SDK structures
- Async accessor methods to `StreamTextResponse` for thread-safe data retrieval (`messages()`, `steps()`, `usage()`, etc.)
- Added `builder()` method for `Tool` for easier construction
- `tool` macro is now re-exported from the main `aisdk` crate for easier access

### Changed
- Model capabilities are now enforced at compile time via marker traits, preventing invalid feature usage (e.g., tool calls on unsupported models).
- Updated tool macro to require a return type of `Tool`
- User does not need to import `aisdk::core::tools::ToolExecute` anymore to work with the tool macro
- `LanguageModel` trait now requires `Clone + 'static` bounds (all providers must implement `Clone`)
- Streaming implementation now uses `tokio::sync::mpsc` instead of `std::sync::mpsc`
- Import path for `tool` macro has changed from `use aisdk_macros::tool` to `use aisdk::macros::tool`


### Removed
- Removed the tool macro re-export from `src/core/mod.rs`. User should use `aisdk_macros::tool` directly
- Removed async-openai dependency
- `Clone` implementation from `LanguageModelRequest<M>`
- `Deref` implementation from `StreamTextResponse` (direct field access no longer works)

### Fixed
- `aisdk-macros` `#[tool]` function unused variable warning even though it is used

## [0.2.1] - 2025-12-02

### Added

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- Hooks (StopWhen, OnStepStart, OnStepFinish) for Language Model Requests
- Reasoning message and configuration options
- Anthropic provider
- Groq provider

### Changed
- Changed standalone (generate_text,stream_text) functions to methods on LanguageModelRequest struct
