//! Capabilities for Models.
//!
//! This module defines public traits that represent the capabilities of models.
//! These traits are used to determine which models are compatible with a given provider.
//!
//! This ensures that selected models are capable of doing the tasks they are intended for.
//! For example, only models that support tool calls can be used for tool usage.

/// A trait that represents a model name.
/// struct name to actual model name
/// e.g. struct Gpt4 {}, impl ModelName for Gpt3 { const MODEL_NAME: &'static str = "gpt-4"; }
pub trait ModelName: Send + Sync + std::fmt::Debug + Clone + 'static {
    /// The underlying API model name.
    const MODEL_NAME: &'static str;
}

/// Marker trait for models that support tool calls.
pub trait ToolCallSupport {}

/// Marker trait for models that support reasoning.
pub trait ReasoningSupport {}

/// Marker trait for models that support structured output ().
pub trait StructuredOutputSupport {}

/// Marker traits for model that support text input.
pub trait TextInputSupport {}

/// Marker trait for models that support video input.
pub trait VideoInputSupport {}

/// Marker trait for models that support audio input.
pub trait AudioInputSupport {}

/// Marker trait for models that support image input.
pub trait ImageInputSupport {}

/// Marker traits for models that support text output.
pub trait TextOutputSupport {}

/// Marker traits for models that support video output.
pub trait VideoOutputSupport {}

/// Marker traits for models that support audio output.
pub trait AudioOutputSupport {}

/// Marker traits for models that support image output.
pub trait ImageOutputSupport {}

/// A dynamic model that accepts any model name as a string.
///
/// Unlike statically-typed models (like `Gpt4o`, `Claude3`, etc.), this model
/// DynamicModel bypasses compile-time capability checking and allows to set any model name as a string.
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - Loading model names from configuration files or environment variables
/// - Runtime model selection based on user input
/// - Supporting custom or fine-tuned models
/// - Forward compatibility with future models not yet defined in the SDK
